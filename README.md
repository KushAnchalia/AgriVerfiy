# AgriVerfiy
Agriverify by Kush with the power of Blockchain
AgriVerify, where you'll blend blockchain technology with organic farming to bring trust and transparency to every crop grown! In this task, you’ll be creating a decentralized platform that empowers farmers to easily certify their organic produce and generate QR codes that consumers can scan for instant verification.

Imagine walking through a market, scanning a QR code on an apple, and instantly seeing its certification, the farm it came from, and the people behind it—all with the power of blockchain!
